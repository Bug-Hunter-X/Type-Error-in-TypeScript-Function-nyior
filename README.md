This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The `greeter` function expects a string argument, but the program attempts to pass an array of strings. This results in a type error. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle the type mismatch by either modifying the function signature to accept an array, or by iterating over the array and calling the function on each element.
